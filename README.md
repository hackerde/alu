# ALU
This short python program simulates how an n-bit ALU works.

  * `alu.py` simulates a 1-bit ALU
  * `alu_extra.py` simulates a n-bit ALU

The number of ALUs required is determined dynamically based upon the size of user input.
The input is in decimal number system.
The output is in binary to simulate the exact output of ALUs.

Be sure to run it using python3:

`python3 alu_extra.py`
